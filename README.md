## Installation (macOS)

Currently, the app is not notarized by Apple, so you'll need to follow these steps to run it:

1. Download `Glide_1.0.0_aarch64.dmg`
2. When trying to open the DMG file:
   - Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
   - Scroll down to Security section
   - Look for the message: "Glide_1.0.0_aarch64.dmg was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer"
   - Click "Open Anyway" and enter your password if prompted
3. You'll need to repeat the same process for the actual `.app` file after mounting the DMG

## Roadmap

- [ ] Notarize and sign the app with Apple to eliminate the current security workaround
